# 21 CFR Part 11 Assessment Checklist

## Purpose
Provide a structured checklist for assessing EDMS controls against Part 11 expectations for electronic records and electronic signatures.

## Instructions
- Mark each item as **Compliant / Partially Compliant / Not Compliant / Not Applicable**.
- Record objective evidence (configuration record, screenshot, SOP, test case, audit log extract).
- Track remediation actions with target dates and owners.

## A. Electronic Signature Controls
| ID | Assessment Question | Status | Evidence | Gap / Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P11-SIG-001 | Are e-signatures unique to one individual and not reused/shared? |  |  |  |

| P11-SIG-003 | Are signature manifestations shown with signer name, date/time, and meaning? |  |  |  |
| P11-SIG-004 | Is signature meaning (reviewed/approved/authored) explicit and controlled? |  |  |  |
| P11-SIG-005 | Are signatures linked to records such that excision/copying/transfer invalidates integrity? |  |  |  |
| P11-SIG-006 | Is there a policy prohibiting signature repudiation and misuse? |  |  |  |

## B. Audit Trail Expectations
| ID | Assessment Question | Status | Evidence | Gap / Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P11-AUD-001 | Are audit trails computer-generated, time-stamped, and enabled for relevant record events? |  |  |  |

| P11-AUD-003 | Are old and new values captured for changes to critical metadata/records? |  |  |  |
| P11-AUD-004 | Are audit trail reviews defined in procedure and periodically executed? |  |  |  |
| P11-AUD-005 | Can audit data be searched, filtered, and exported for inspection? |  |  |  |

## C. Authority Checks
| ID | Assessment Question | Status | Evidence | Gap / Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P11-AUTH-001 | Are system access rights role-based and approved by management/QA? |  |  |  |
| P11-AUTH-002 | Do workflows enforce role-appropriate actions (author vs reviewer vs approver)? |  |  |  |
| P11-AUTH-003 | Are segregation-of-duties rules enforced where required (e.g., no self-approval)? |  |  |  |
| P11-AUTH-004 | Are onboarding, transfer, and termination controls effective and timely? |  |  |  |
| P11-AUTH-005 | Are privileged access activities logged and periodically reviewed? |  |  |  |

## D. Record Retention and Retrieval
| ID | Assessment Question | Status | Evidence | Gap / Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P11-RET-001 | Are retention schedules defined and configured by document class/region? |  |  |  |
| P11-RET-002 | Is record readability maintained for the full retention period? |  |  |  |
| P11-RET-003 | Are archival and restore processes validated and controlled? |  |  |  |
| P11-RET-004 | Are legal hold and deletion lock controls implemented? |  |  |  |
| P11-RET-005 | Can complete and accurate copies be produced in human-readable/electronic form? |  |  |  |

## E. Validation & Procedural Controls
| ID | Assessment Question | Status | Evidence | Gap / Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P11-VAL-001 | Is the system validated for intended use with documented lifecycle deliverables? |  |  |  |
| P11-VAL-002 | Are SOPs in place for operation, administration, change control, and periodic review? |  |  |  |
| P11-VAL-003 | Is training completed and maintained for all applicable users? |  |  |  |
